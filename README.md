Machine Learning Models

This repository is a structured collection of machine learning models that I am studying and mastering.
The goal is to build a clear and practical resource, with well-documented Jupyter notebooks that not only show how each model works but also explain the underlying concepts in depth.

📚 Project Structure

Each model has its own dedicated folder containing multiple notebooks:

Concept explanation: step-by-step theory with formulas and intuition.

From scratch implementation: building the model without external ML libraries.

With libraries: using scikit-learn (and others when relevant) to compare with the scratch version.

Case studies: applying the model to real-world datasets.

🚀 Models (Work in Progress)

 Linear Models

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

 Decision Trees

 Ensemble Methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)

 Support Vector Machines (SVM)

 Neural Networks (intro)

 Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, PCA, etc.)

More models will be added progressively.

🛠️ Requirements

To run the notebooks, install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt


(Dependencies mainly include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.)

🎯 Objectives

Build strong intuition and mathematical understanding of ML algorithms.

Practice from-scratch implementations to reinforce core concepts.

Use case studies to connect theory to practice.

Create a learning path for myself and others interested in mastering ML.

📖 How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/machine_learning.git
cd machine_learning


Open Jupyter Lab / Notebook.

Navigate to the folder of the model you want to explore.
