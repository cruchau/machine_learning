# Machine Learning Models

This repository is a structured collection of **machine learning models** that I am studying and mastering.  
The goal is to build a clear and practical resource, with well-documented **Jupyter notebooks** that not only show how each model works but also explain the **underlying concepts in depth**.

## 📚 Project Structure

Each model has its own dedicated folder containing multiple notebooks:

- **Concept explanation** → step-by-step theory with formulas and intuition.  
- **From scratch implementation** → building the model without external ML libraries.  
- **With libraries** → using `scikit-learn` (and others when relevant) to compare with the scratch version.  
- **Case studies** → applying the model to real-world datasets.

- [ ] **Dimensionality Reduction**  
- [ ] **Anomaly Detection**
- [ ] **Time Series**

_More models will be added progressively._
